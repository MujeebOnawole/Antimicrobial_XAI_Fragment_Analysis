DUAL-NEGATIVE DESIGN INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------
Based on negative size-effect corrected analysis:

NEGATIVE PATTERN INTERPRETATION:
These fragments show consistent NEGATIVE activity, indicating:
- Chemical features that PREVENT activity against specific pathogen pairs
- Structural motifs to AVOID in dual-activity compound design
- Selectivity patterns that distinguish pathogen vulnerabilities

NEGATIVE WEIGHTING STRATEGY IMPACT
------------------------------
Negative size-effect correction successfully applied:
- Accounts for unequal source negative compound populations
- Results reflect true negative chemical selectivity patterns
- Unbiased insights for rational compound design

DUAL-NEGATIVE DRUG DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------
1. AVOID features identified in negative patterns
2. Use negative insights to guide positive fragment selection
3. Consider pathogen-specific vulnerabilities revealed by negative patterns
4. Combine with positive dual-activity data for comprehensive design
5. Apply negative size-effect corrections in future analyses
