KEY INSIGHTS FOR TRIPLE-ACTIVE FRAGMENTS
--------------------------------------------------
1. RARITY AND VALUE:
   - Triple-active compounds represent only 16.2% of tested compounds
   - These fragments capture the chemical essence of rare broad-spectrum activity
   - High therapeutic potential for multi-pathogen infections

2. SCAFFOLD vs SUBSTITUENT PATTERNS:
   - Statistical comparison not possible due to insufficient data
   - Both fragment types appear suitable for triple-activity design

3. CHEMICAL DRIVERS OF TRIPLE ACTIVITY:
   - No strong chemical-activity correlations found
   - Triple activity may depend on complex feature interactions

DRUG DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
1. BROAD-SPECTRUM STRATEGY:
   - Target: Multi-pathogen infections (hospital-acquired, immunocompromised patients)
   - Advantage: Single drug for Gram+, Gram-, and fungal coverage
   - Challenge: Balance activity across three distinct pathogen classes

2. FRAGMENT-BASED DESIGN:
   - Use both scaffolds and substituents as design starting points
   - Prioritize fragments with high broad-spectrum index (≥1.5)

3. OPTIMIZATION TARGETS:
   - Target activity rate: ≥96% (current average)
   - Minimize pathogen-specific activity variation
   - Optimize for membrane permeability across cell wall types

4. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Development path: Broad-spectrum anti-infective
   - Market need: High (antimicrobial resistance crisis)
   - Regulatory: Complex (multi-pathogen efficacy required)
   - Competition: Limited broad-spectrum options available
