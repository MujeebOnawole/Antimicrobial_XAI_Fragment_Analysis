PERMUTATION-BASED PATHOGEN FRAGMENT ANALYSIS
XAI-Derived Positive Fragments with Testing Bias Correction
================================================================================

STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------
Approach: Permutation tests using ALL fragments
Testing bias correction: Weighted by original dataset sizes
Permutations per test: 10,000
Multiple testing correction: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR
Effect size threshold: 0.3 (Cohen's d)
Significance threshold: p < 0.05 (corrected)

ORIGINAL DATASET CONTEXT
----------------------------------------
Compounds tested in original screens:
  SA: 54,277 compounds
  EC: 44,920 compounds
  CA: 28,476 compounds

XAI-positive fragments extracted:
  SA: 2332 fragments (4.296% hit rate)
  EC: 537 fragments (1.195% hit rate)
  CA: 1234 fragments (4.333% hit rate)


PERMUTATION TEST RESULTS
----------------------------------------
Total pairwise tests performed: 93
Statistically significant patterns: 11
False discovery rate: 69.9%

VALIDATED CHEMICAL DIFFERENCES:

EC vs CA: num hbd is 1.92x higher in EC (effect: 0.685, p: 0.00e+00)
SA vs EC: logp is 1.29x higher in SA (effect: 0.415, p: 0.00e+00)
SA vs EC: nitrogen count is 0.79x lower in EC (effect: 0.398, p: 0.00e+00)
SA vs EC: amine is 0.79x lower in EC (effect: 0.398, p: 0.00e+00)
SA vs CA: num hbd is 1.50x higher in SA (effect: 0.354, p: 0.00e+00)
EC vs CA: aromatic heterocycles is 2.17x higher in EC (effect: 0.336, p: 0.00e+00)
SA vs EC: num heteroatoms is 0.86x lower in EC (effect: 0.329, p: 0.00e+00)
EC vs CA: sulfur count is 1.69x higher in EC (effect: 0.325, p: 0.00e+00)
SA vs EC: tpsa is 0.83x lower in EC (effect: 0.321, p: 0.00e+00)
EC vs CA: amide is 4.24x higher in EC (effect: 0.318, p: 0.00e+00)


DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
Based on permutation-validated differences:

SA (Gram+) - Validated Features:
  - Enhance logp: 1.29x advantage over EC
  - Enhance num hbd: 1.50x advantage over CA

EC (Gram-) - Validated Features:
  - Enhance num hbd: 1.92x advantage over CA
  - Enhance aromatic heterocycles: 2.17x advantage over CA
  - Enhance sulfur count: 1.69x advantage over CA

Note: These results use ALL 4103 XAI-derived fragments
and account for original testing bias through permutation weighting.
