NEGATIVE FRAGMENT PATHOGEN ANALYSIS
XAI-Derived Activity-Killing Features - WHAT TO AVOID
================================================================================

STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------
Approach: Permutation tests using ALL negative fragments
Purpose: Identify features that consistently KILL antimicrobial activity
Testing bias correction: Weighted by original dataset sizes
Permutations per test: 10,000
Multiple testing correction: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR
Effect size threshold: 0.3 (Cohen's d)
Significance threshold: p < 0.05 (corrected)

ORIGINAL DATASET CONTEXT
----------------------------------------
Compounds tested in original screens:
  SA: 54,277 compounds
  EC: 44,920 compounds
  CA: 28,476 compounds

XAI-negative fragments extracted (features that kill activity):
  SA: 398 negative fragments (0.733% negative hit rate)
  EC: 161 negative fragments (0.358% negative hit rate)
  CA: 227 negative fragments (0.797% negative hit rate)


NEGATIVE FRAGMENT PERMUTATION RESULTS
----------------------------------------
Total pairwise tests performed: 93
Statistically significant negative patterns: 22
False discovery rate: 37.6%

VALIDATED FEATURES TO AVOID:
------------------------------
AVOID num aliphatic rings for EC: 1.67x more problematic than for CA (effect: 0.564, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID num hba for CA: 0.72x more problematic than for SA (effect: 0.556, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID fraction csp3 for EC: 1.51x more problematic than for CA (effect: 0.508, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID num saturated rings for SA: 2.40x more problematic than for CA (effect: 0.502, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID num aliphatic rings for SA: 1.72x more problematic than for CA (effect: 0.499, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID fraction csp3 for SA: 1.54x more problematic than for CA (effect: 0.490, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID num heteroatoms for CA: 0.76x more problematic than for SA (effect: 0.481, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID nitrogen count for CA: 0.70x more problematic than for SA (effect: 0.473, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID amine for CA: 0.70x more problematic than for SA (effect: 0.473, p: 0.00e+00)
AVOID num saturated rings for EC: 1.88x more problematic than for CA (effect: 0.446, p: 0.00e+00)


DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS - FEATURES TO AVOID
--------------------------------------------------
Based on permutation-validated negative patterns:

SA (Gram+) - Features to AVOID:
  - MINIMIZE num saturated rings: 2.40x more detrimental than for CA
  - MINIMIZE num aliphatic rings: 1.72x more detrimental than for CA
  - MINIMIZE fraction csp3: 1.54x more detrimental than for CA

EC (Gram-) - Features to AVOID:
  - MINIMIZE num aliphatic rings: 1.67x more detrimental than for CA
  - MINIMIZE fraction csp3: 1.51x more detrimental than for CA
  - MINIMIZE num saturated rings: 1.88x more detrimental than for CA

CA (Fungi) - Features to AVOID:
  - MINIMIZE num hba: 0.72x more detrimental than for SA
  - MINIMIZE num heteroatoms: 0.76x more detrimental than for SA
  - MINIMIZE nitrogen count: 0.70x more detrimental than for SA


INTEGRATED DESIGN STRATEGY:
------------------------------
To design effective antimicrobials:
1. Use POSITIVE fragment analysis to identify features to ENHANCE
2. Use this NEGATIVE fragment analysis to identify features to AVOID
3. Balance both insights for optimal pathogen-specific design

Example strategic approach:
For SA: Enhance [positive features] while avoiding [negative features]
For EC: Enhance [positive features] while avoiding [negative features]
For CA: Enhance [positive features] while avoiding [negative features]

Note: These results use ALL 786 XAI-derived negative fragments
and account for original testing bias through permutation weighting.

** USE WITH POSITIVE FRAGMENT ANALYSIS FOR COMPLETE PICTURE **
